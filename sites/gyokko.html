            <p>Gyokko had a very bizarre and grotesque physiology, taking on the form of a pale white, abstracted, grotesque humanoid figure with a muscular upper torso that has no arms and resembles that of an armless statue growing from a porcelain vase, similar to a djinn. His midsection is a red-violet color while his lower-half, or his tail is black. He had multiple infant-like hands that line along his head and back which he can retract at will. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Gyokko's face was even more distorted, with large green-lipped mouths located where one would expect his eyes sockets to be located, which always displayed his hyperrealistic teeth. His actual eyes were located vertically from one another on his face; one eye appeared in the constantly open bottom mouth and the other was seated at the center of his forehead.

            </p><br>
            <p>When in battle, Gyokko was shown to molt and transform into his true form, which bore heavy resemblance to that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Merman">merman</a>. In this state, Gyokko retained his facial features and muscular physique but now possessed a more humanoid body covered in transparent scales akin to a fish He also grew much larger, attains longer fish tail-like hair, dark markings on various places around his body, webbed hands with turquoise blue scales, and a long serpent-like tail in place of his legs. In addition, the mouth which displays his lower eye has 4 stitches, with 2 on each side, giving it a rag-doll like appearance.

            <div class="personality title" id="personality">
                Personality
            </div>
            <p>Gyokko was shown to be an easily excitable demon, constantly fawning over new inspirations for what he deems his "art" or what he finds to be sublime, sometimes even going against his initial impressions. He was easily swayed into euphoria whenever <a href="/wiki/Muzan_Kibutsuji" title="Muzan Kibutsuji">Muzan</a> was involved, trying not only to please him, but finding joy in being decapitated and having his head held by Muzan. Although he was dismayed he would have to work together with <a href="/wiki/Hantengu" title="Hantengu">Hantengu</a>, he nonetheless reasoned it was fine since Muzan ordered it. He also seemed to be somewhat sardonic and condescending; upon sensing <a href="/wiki/Akaza" title="Akaza">Akaza</a>'s presence within the Infinity Castle, he almost let out his inner feelings to the demon about being glad he believed him to be dead before correcting himself mid-sentence, even if Akaza was not fooled by his false support.
            </p><br>
            <p>Gyokko was also short-tempered, shallow, and arrogant, especially when it comes to things regarding his "art", as seen when he was easily enraged by <a href="/wiki/Muichiro_Tokito" title="Muichiro Tokito">Muichiro</a> when the latter began to insult and make fun of the quality of his art to the point of bleeding from his blood vessels out of sheer fury, and through his conversation with the Hashira, constantly praised himself as "beautiful" and his work even more so, further reinforcing his arrogant and narcissistic personality and even insulting Muichiro as an "ape" for not appreciating his art. His arrogance was most prominently displayed after he was beheaded by <a href="/wiki/Muichiro_Tokito" title="Muichiro Tokito">Muichiro Tokito</a>, referring to the Mist Hashira as an inferior and lower life form while calling himself a superb and chosen being.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-3916cfe729514bbc95bf37af2112a40f_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-3916cfe729514bbc95bf37af2112a40f-3">[3]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p>Gyokko revealed himself to be incredibly petty and jealous, as seen when he attacked and mutilated <a href="/wiki/Hotaru_Haganezuka" title="Hotaru Haganezuka">Hotaru Haganezuka</a> due to his jealousy of the latter's focus and dedication to his work, surpassing his own zeal when working on his own art and made him want to instead make the latter lose his focus and waste time on the swordsmith due to this petty jealousy.
            </p><br>
            <p>Gyokko had a particularly morbid sense of taste, which was showcased when <a href="/wiki/Doma" title="Doma">Doma</a> told him he placed a human head on top of his pots like a plant; although Gyokko was slightly taken aback since the pot was not made with such an intention in mind, he nonetheless approved of such use and decided to use it as further inspiration. The extent of this morbid and violent obsession for his was shown even more when he brutally attacked several swordsmiths and used their corpses to create a "beautiful" piece by mangling their bodies together along with sticking several swords into them.
            </p><br>
            <p>His extreme sadism was further exposed when he went into great detail of explaining his "artwork"; from the many distorted body parts that stood out, to the built-in "feature" of being able to twist a stabbed sword in order to cause extreme pain and bleeding to one of the mangled swordsmiths, demonstrating he not only left his victims unnaturally alive, but that unlike other Upper Ranks, Gyokko liked to draw out his victims’ suffering.

            <p>As the holder of the fifth highest position in the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Kizuki" title="Twelve Kizuki">Twelve Kizuki</a>, Gyokko was an extremely powerful demon. His unique <a href="/wiki/Blood_Demon_Art" title="Blood Demon Art">Blood Demon Art</a> and techniques allow him to easily outclass the average demons and give him the necessary edge to overwhelm and kill even the <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a>, the most skilled and powerful swordsman in the <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Corps" title="Demon Slayer Corps">Demon Slayer Corps</a>. As Upper Rank Five, Gyokko is more powerful than <a href="/wiki/Gyutaro" title="Gyutaro">Gyutaro</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daki" title="Daki">Daki</a>, the former having killed 15 Hashira and the latter having killed 7.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-0d17cb7d2f2a0bf21aded588bfdf18e1_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-0d17cb7d2f2a0bf21aded588bfdf18e1-4">[4]</a></sup> Gyokko has displayed many impressive feats, such as spawning a plethora of powerful demon-like creatures with unique attacks, highly unorthodox movement both within and out of his pots, and a second hidden form. Most notably, in <a href="/wiki/Muichiro_Tokito_vs_Gyokko" title="Muichiro Tokito vs Gyokko">his duel</a> with <a href="/wiki/Muichiro_Tokito" title="Muichiro Tokito">Muichiro Tokito</a>, Gyokko was able to overpower and hold the Hashira back for the majority of their fight, even managing to bring him to the brink of death. If not for Gyokko's inherent egotistical nature and Muichiro awakening his <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Mark" title="Demon Slayer Mark">Demon Slayer Mark</a>, the Upper Rank would have more than likely been able to kill him.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Talented Artist:</b> Due to his obsession with pots, Gyokko became very skilled at painting and making them, so much so that <a href="/wiki/Muzan_Kibutsuji" title="Muzan Kibutsuji">Muzan</a> has taken a keen interest in them, even selling them for a high price, implying that they were made with amazing skill and craftsmanship.
            </p><br>
            <p><b><a href="/wiki/Flesh_Manipulation" title="Flesh Manipulation">Flesh Manipulation</a>:</b> Like all demons, Gyokko possessed the ability to manipulate his own flesh. He used this ability to shift his facial features and adopt his unusual djinn-like physiology. Gyokko also displayed the ability to grow numerous short arms on his head and torso, even while he was decapitated.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-3916cfe729514bbc95bf37af2112a40f_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-3916cfe729514bbc95bf37af2112a40f-3">[3]</a></sup> Additionally, Gyokko's numerous vases were made from his own flesh, as seen when he was able to instantly form them in his hand in order to use.
            </p><br>
            <p><b><a href="/wiki/Regeneration" title="Regeneration">Immense Regeneration</a>:</b> As an Upper Rank demon, Gyokko had very powerful regeneration. This was shown when he survived being decapitated by <a href="/wiki/Muzan_Kibutsuji" title="Muzan Kibutsuji">Muzan Kibutsuji</a> and later sealed off the wound and reattached his head.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-03e9d83f9d03dc50b0fcb69cb8d70cd9_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-03e9d83f9d03dc50b0fcb69cb8d70cd9-5">[5]</a></sup> He also displayed the ability to quickly heal injuries inflicted by <a href="/wiki/Nichirin_Sword" title="Nichirin Sword">Nichirin Swords</a> without much difficulty.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-6bba0b4d2be0b7114dd360273dda3868_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-6bba0b4d2be0b7114dd360273dda3868-6">[6]</a></sup>Most astoundingly, Gyokko was shown being able to survive direct decapitation from a Nichirin sword, attempting to grow his body back from the stump of his neck, though Muichiro was able to overwhelm it by slicing him into countless small pieces, eventually killing him.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-9f3103997b0e5bc40a374dd235b8662e_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-9f3103997b0e5bc40a374dd235b8662e-7">[7]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Molting Transformation:</b> In dire situations, Gyokko could molt and transform into his true form, boosting all his abilities and liberates him from his vase, allowing him to move freely without needing to teleport.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-b58bc314d9365c0e4e28f4582ba17ad7_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-b58bc314d9365c0e4e28f4582ba17ad7-8">[8]</a></sup> Gyokko's true body was extremely durable as well, since the Upper Rank remarked that the scales that cover his body are harder than diamond. Furthermore, whatever Gyokko touches was instantly transmuted into fish, which made him extremely dangerous to fight in close range.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-16626ea07fc0d59c78462488528c8f5f_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-16626ea07fc0d59c78462488528c8f5f-9">[9]</a></sup>

            <p><b>Porcelain Vase Spells:</b> Gyokko's Blood Demon Art revolved around his porcelain vases. He was able to spawn them anywhere within his vicinity and create multiple pots of varying sizes at once. Gyokko first displayed the ability to freely teleport from one pot to another instantaneously, offsetting his lack of legs and allowing him to travel far distances with minimal effort as well as to evade attacks easily.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-41404b98a8fe019580273df5d15813a5_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-41404b98a8fe019580273df5d15813a5-18">[18]</a></sup> Gyokko could also trap objects (such as people) inside his pots. If the object he wishes to seal is too big, the pots can simply compress them to fit inside.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-e1d3d530c7b2d4424299750d792b2ba2_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e1d3d530c7b2d4424299750d792b2ba2-19">[19]</a></sup> The pots also seem to give Gyokko liberty of whatever was inside, which he uses to merge the swordsmiths together in impossible ways and allows him to create whatever he pleases inside them.
            </p><br>
            <p>During his attack on the Swordsmith Village, Gyokko spawned numerous gigantic fish-like amalgamations to terrorize the village and kill its inhabitants. They were unable to be killed by regular means and only die when the pots on their back are destroyed.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-e550be27a415b33618e4aa6ef630f9d3_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e550be27a415b33618e4aa6ef630f9d3-20">[20]</a></sup> These creatures all possessed unique traits and characteristics, some had sharp claws,<sup id="cite_ref-auto-a949df3495a2f9202a46b33a4d01dd8f_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-a949df3495a2f9202a46b33a4d01dd8f-21">[21]</a></sup> some had multiple humanoid legs or even monstrous teeth.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-21a79c0e7397602f9d205a148ba6c33e_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-21a79c0e7397602f9d205a148ba6c33e-22">[22]</a></sup> They also seemed to be decently powerful, as these amalgamations were able to kill the Demon Slayers that were meant to guard to village.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-e2397a0ca93dd7df86d218d7ea9780f5_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e2397a0ca93dd7df86d218d7ea9780f5-23">[23]</a></sup> However, their strength still paled in comparison to the <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Mitsuri_Kanroji" title="Mitsuri Kanroji">Mitsuri</a> and Muichiro swiftly subdued these spawn with ease.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-b35432f13f83e52890c2cedf45b8c388_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-b35432f13f83e52890c2cedf45b8c388-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-7fe8ea402619c348fe88ed525e1ee0e4_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-7fe8ea402619c348fe88ed525e1ee0e4-25">[25]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p>Gyokko's Blood Demon Art was notably themed around the sea and aquatic lifeforms, as his techniques were based on summoning non-sentient creatures that resembled fish from his pots. These fish monsters similarly possessed differing abilities and characteristics: some of them could shoot out a barrage of poisonous needles at his targets<sup id="cite_ref-auto-8b2f1c464414ceb08adf87f6d0aba6f3_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-8b2f1c464414ceb08adf87f6d0aba6f3-26">[26]</a></sup> or leave behind dangerous poison once they are killed.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-159826d328b1e585458da4f523877ec8_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-159826d328b1e585458da4f523877ec8-27">[27]</a></sup> He also summoned goldfish-like monsters with scythe-like appendages to threaten <a href="/wiki/Hotaru_Haganezuka" title="Hotaru Haganezuka">Hotaru Haganezuka</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-6b7d91c4938c34e523bf617957515e28_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-6b7d91c4938c34e523bf617957515e28-28">[28]</a></sup> Gyokko could also summon giant octopus tentacles from his vases to restrain his enemies or destroy the surroundings.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-7e3e6fc20e1e5e6615adefb7a2fd3c6e_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-7e3e6fc20e1e5e6615adefb7a2fd3c6e-29">[29]</a></sup> Lastly, Gyokko could also manipulate and create water from his porcelain vases, which he can use as a cannon-like attack in which he shoots out powerful streams of water or shape water into sharp, high-pressure tendrils to cut targets like a sharp whip or even suffocate his targets by trapping them inside an extremely durable vase made of water.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-5a915572ddd7bbdfb96becf7c04a41cc_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-5a915572ddd7bbdfb96becf7c04a41cc-30">[30]</a></sup>
