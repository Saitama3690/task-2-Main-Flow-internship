            <p>Enmu was a slender young man who appeared to be in his mid twenties. He possessed a medium build and was of average height.

He had three square-shaped markings on each of his cheeks, each separated by a smaller square, which fade from green to yellow in color, and straight, chin-length hair of a dark black color which he wore parted to his right, the right side tucked behind his ear. His hair fades into a red-pink color near the ends, but appears blue at the tips of the two longer, shoulder-length strands that curve upwards and outwards below the base of his neck, from under the rest of his hair.

            <p>Enmu wore a long, black button-up coat that arched upwards on either side of his legs so that only the two tails in front and behind fall down below his knees, and a white dress shirt, the cuffs of which appear over those of his coat. He also wore a pair of pinstriped pale gray pants and plain, slightly heeled shoes of a similar color.

            <div class="personality title" id="personality">
                Personality
            </div>
            <p>Enmu was cold, callous, and sadistic, openly stating that he enjoyed the pain and suffering of humans; his favorite method of torment was giving them a happy and pleasant dream before turning it into a nightmare and taking pleasure in the agonized expressions they made as he tortured them. This sadism even extends to his fellow demons, as he relished seeing his fellow Lower Ranks being killed right in front of his eyes.
            </p><br>
            <p>As well as sadism, Enmu was shown to exhibit masochistic behaviors, a multitude of times he had expressed positive reactions to pain inflicted on him. This enjoyment, however, seems to be limited to those he only respects and holds himself loyal to, the required power over him mostly being hierarchical rather than literal. This masochism was shown most prominently in the <a href="/wiki/Lower_Ranks_Meeting" title="Lower Ranks Meeting">Lower Ranks Meeting</a>, during which, upon being gifted with <a href="/wiki/Muzan_Kibutsuji" title="Muzan Kibutsuji">Muzan's</a> blood, a typically torturous and painful experience that could have potentially killed him, Enmu appeared with a smiling and flushed expression, enjoying the experience. Though, these masochistic tendencies were not prevalent in his <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayers_vs_Enmu" title="Demon Slayers vs Enmu">battle against the Demon Slayers</a> as when they successfully attacked him, he was seen only being amused, shocked, or frustrated by his failures.
            </p><br>
            <p>Like most demons, Enmu was shown to have little to no care for human life; he saw humans as nothing more than mere pawns, as he did not bother to warn his human minions of the various dangers of facing Demon Slayers, and simply considered them to be expendable. He also seemed to revel in turning humans into his desperate servants by using his power to give them nice and pleasant dreams, before he pulled them out and falsely promised to give them more if they helped him. Enmu was also intelligent and cautious in approach to anything he executed, having complete understanding of his power's strengths and weaknesses and making sure to both exploit and avoid them respectively in order to succeed. 
            </p><br>
            <p>However, upon being given more blood and therefore further empowered by Muzan, Enmu seemed to have become overconfident, arrogant and greedy, as seen when he acted more recklessly to obtain more blood from Muzan in order to properly challenge one of the Upper Ranks to a blood duel in order to take their place. This eventually proved to be his undoing, as he did not predict his attempts to exhaust the Demon Slayers would be insufficient, eventually leading to his beheading by <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro Kamado</a>. In his final moments, Enmu blamed his death on his opponents and refused to acknowledge his lacking foresight and cockiness, reaffirming his self-belief that he was destined for more and cursing every one of his attackers for getting past him.

            <div class="History title" id="History">
                History
            </div>
            <p>During his life as a human, he had a tendency since childhood to not be able to distinguish the difference between dreams and reality, and this caused many problems for the people around him. As an adult, he pretended to be a doctor. Under the guise of treatments, he misused procedures like hypnotic therapies, as well as convincing patients who did not have long to live that they had recovered their health. Even when people realized, after some time, that all he was doing was disingenuous, he continued doing his negligent treatment on patients.
            </p><br>
            <p>One night, Muzan encountered and wanted to completely devour Enmu. His intestines were eaten by the demon and he was not supposed to turn into a demon at first, but because he felt no pain from the fatal wound, he envied and praised Muzan. With those last words, his heart and brain stopped working, eventually leading Muzan to turn him into a demon. Enmu knew that he had been transformed by Muzan on a whim and would only remember him in passing, so Enmu did his best to ascend to the rank of Lower Rank One.<sup id="cite_ref-db2_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-db2-2">[2]</a></sup>

Upon receiving more blood from <a href="/wiki/Muzan_Kibutsuji" title="Muzan Kibutsuji">Muzan Kibutsuji</a>, his abilities were further enhanced. This level of ability was shown when Enmu's shapeshifting ability evolved to the point he was able fuse with a vehicle as big as a train. Additionally, his unorthodox sleep-based <a href="/wiki/Blood_Demon_Art" title="Blood Demon Art">Blood Demon Art</a> enabled him to render over 200 passengers in the Mugen Train, including the likes of the <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a> <a href="/wiki/Kyojuro_Rengoku" title="Kyojuro Rengoku">Kyojuro Rengoku</a>, asleep and almost completely vulnerable. In direct combat, Enmu was able to hold his own against <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro Kamado</a> who had mastered <a href="/wiki/Breathing_Styles#Total_Concentration_Breathing" class="mw-redirect" title="Breathing Styles">Total Concentration Constant</a>, evading his sword swings with ease and constantly putting the Demon Slayer to sleep with his spells.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-9765010c5b9de7d21b293cd6ef46c935_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-9765010c5b9de7d21b293cd6ef46c935-10">[10]</a></sup> In his fused form, every single inch of the Mugen Train became his body, which took the combined effort of Tanjiro, <a href="/wiki/Zenitsu_Agatsuma" title="Zenitsu Agatsuma">Zenitsu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira" title="Inosuke Hashibira">Inosuke</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nezuko_Kamado" title="Nezuko Kamado">Nezuko</a> and Kyojuro himself to ward off and defeat. Despite all this, Enmu realized after his defeat that he wasn't quite at the level of an Upper Rank demon and he still paled in comparison to the likes of <a href="/wiki/Daki" title="Daki">Daki</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gyutaro" title="Gyutaro">Gyutaro</a>, the lowest members of the Upper Ranks.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-da3d71e5504ae2c5872e7aa3053ad7d5_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-da3d71e5504ae2c5872e7aa3053ad7d5-11">[11]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Enhanced Speed &amp; Reflexes:</b> As a member of the Twelve Kizuki, Enmu had assimilated a high concentration of Muzan's blood which has greatly improved his physical abilities and attributes, most notably his movement speed and reflexes. This was shown during his initial battle against <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro</a> where he was able to dodge and react to every single one of the Demon Slayer's attacks with little effort, even moving so fast that Tanjiro had trouble keeping up.
            </p><br>
            <p><b><a href="/wiki/Flesh_Manipulation" title="Flesh Manipulation">Flesh Manipulation</a>:</b> Like all demons, Enmu possessed the ability to manipulate his own flesh. However, as a member of the Twelve Kizuki, Enmu's manipulation was at a very high degree; he was able to mix his blood with ink that is almost untraceable, he used his flesh to create rope and bony awls able to enter dreams and cripple his victims, and he was able create tentacles strong enough to fully restrain Nezuko, who was a powerful demon herself. These tentacles also could be formed without limit and would have overwhelmed the Demon Slayers if it had not been for Tanjiro's successful decapitation. 
            </p><br>
            <li><b>Flesh Detachments:</b>  Enmu showed the ability to create flesh detachments from his own body, able to create and detach one of his own hands and send it out independent from his main body. Enmu was also able to communicate and see through his hand by utilizing the eye and mouth on it.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-adf71b7505801a275ec3bd44cb02fcb9_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-adf71b7505801a275ec3bd44cb02fcb9-12">[12]</a></sup> Later, Enmu was shown to be capable of creating a flesh puppet, in order to fool Tanjiro into thinking that it was his real body.</li>
            <li><b>Fusion:</b> Enmu also displayed the ability to absorb and incorporate himself into large, inanimate objects. He was able to assimilate an entire train and transform it into his main body, planning on eating the over 200 passengers on his new train body.</li>

            <p><b>Sleep Inducement:</b> Enmu's Blood Demon Art granted him the ability to force anyone into a deep sleep.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-83129c2fe6b8776ae7d50a72bd309dba_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-83129c2fe6b8776ae7d50a72bd309dba-13">[13]</a></sup> He can do this through different means, some more subtle than others, but all effectively leaving his foes vulnerable and unable to fight. The slumber induced was very potent and it took considerable effort to wake the victim up, as seen when Nezuko headbutted Tanjiro quite hard but failed to awaken him.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-450f1201cf8242d42bedd6ff6e802676_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-450f1201cf8242d42bedd6ff6e802676-14">[14]</a></sup> However, his state of sleep was not perfect, as Enmu carefully preferred to stay away from Demon Slayers out of fear that his bloodlust could awaken them, although he was far less cautious against normal human targets.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Dream Manipulation:</b> Enmu's Blood Demon Art's secondary ability was his power to enter, manipulate and control someone's dreams when they are asleep. When using his technique, his victims experienced joyous dreams normally suited to each person, taking advantage of their vulnerabilities and ensuring they are unable to tell the difference from reality, thus rapidly seducing them to embrace the utopian visions that lay before them. This level of vulnerability made it far easier for Enmu to manipulate his prey, bribing people to do his bidding by giving them happy dreams, which also doubled as a means to perpetuate his own sadistic practices. Just like he can bestow dreams, Enmu was equally capable of forcing nightmares, which he uses both as a psychological attack and a means of torture, something he was particularly fond of when preying on humans.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-88b9682b1d2bb2583a05a1b5c5fec9f9_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-88b9682b1d2bb2583a05a1b5c5fec9f9-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-e8ea8fbfb823789130cc6f0f51f64d97_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e8ea8fbfb823789130cc6f0f51f64d97-16">[16]</a></sup> But similarly to his ability to induce sleep, Enmu's dreams, while extremely potent, were not perfect, as one can be capable of resisting its effects through sufficient willpower, which allowed an affected person to realize they are in fact living an illusion. However, realizing they are in a dream is not enough to end the induced sleep, as Tanjiro was only able to force himself out of his induced slumber by committing suicide inside his dream, something he was forced to do repeatedly during his battle with the Lower Rank, doing so instantly every time he was forced to sleep.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-638d993263437632068747c09d298a7e_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-638d993263437632068747c09d298a7e-17">[17]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p>When trapping someone inside their dreams, Enmu may enter the realm inside their minds. This dream dimension is not infinite, but circular with the dreamer at the center and a solid wall at the edge (the wall being totally indistinguishable from farther terrain beyond it). By cutting a hole in this border, one can leave the dream and enter the subconscious of the dreamer. The subconscious reflected the individual's character, Tanjiro's subconscious for example was a beautiful endless sky, noted to feel safe and warm. In the subconscious, there is an entity known as the "Spiritual Core".<sup id="cite_ref-auto-c3e5f35818117647b5268571369c4848_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-c3e5f35818117647b5268571369c4848-18">[18]</a></sup> Should this core be destroyed, it effectively destroys the target's mind, leaving their body as an empty shell, thus allowing Enmu to kill his victims in their dreams. 
            </p><br>
            <p>However, it has to be noted that there was a danger of being affected and possibly mentally changed by the unconscious mind of his victim, as seen when one of Enmu's human agents was touched by Tanjiro's inner kindness and subsequently lost his will to destroy his spiritual core. For this reason, Enmu always has someone else enter into the target's dream instead of entering it himself.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-4366d47cdc92d89a7d9e1dcfb7a6cab3_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-4366d47cdc92d89a7d9e1dcfb7a6cab3-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-83129c2fe6b8776ae7d50a72bd309dba_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-83129c2fe6b8776ae7d50a72bd309dba-13">[13]</a></sup>
