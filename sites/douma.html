            <p>Doma is a tall young man with a lean but toned and muscular body, who is of extremely pale complexion and possessed unusually long, pointed nails that appeared to be stained with a pale blue color. He possesses long platinum blond hair that he wore parted to his right, the shorter parts around his face seeming to flare out to either side around his head, curving backwards with one lock slanting down to the right of his face to fall between his eyes, while the longer parts were left to drape centrally down his back in a thinning spiral. Due to his beauty, he was made a cult leader and seen as a divine being due to such.

            </p><br>
            <p>On occasion, Doma may also have been seen sporting a black cloak, which he drapes around his shoulders, two lengths of purple and black cloth with a rectangular pattern also hanging from it around his neck, as well as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Crown" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Black Crown">black crown</a> which is lined with gold around its frontal plates and has flowing black ribbons dangling from each of its sides. He is also usually seen holding a pair of sharp fans that were made entirely out of shining gold, a lotus design engraved across them and a green tassel at the base, which acted as his primary weapons.

            <div class="personality title" id="personality">
                Personality
            </div>
            <p>Doma is outwardly friendly and cheery, possessing an approachable and charismatic air. <a href="/wiki/Kanae_Kocho" title="Kanae Kocho">Kanae Kocho</a> describes him as talking and acting in a calm and carefree manner. However, it is soon revealed that Doma has psychopathic tendencies. He adopts sick beliefs and habits, such as devouring his cult's followers with the belief he is saving them from their suffering and pain. He believes he is saving them from their suffering by letting them live inside his body. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Under his carefree and unassuming demeanor, Doma is a cold and calculating individual with an extremely keen intellect. His high intelligence may be the reason why he looks down on humans, genuinely believing that they are pathetic and pitiful. He even cried out of pity for them. His condescending attitude towards humans was also showcased when he was decapitated by the combined efforts of <a href="/wiki/Shinobu_Kocho" title="Shinobu Kocho">Shinobu Kocho</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira" title="Inosuke Hashibira">Inosuke Hashibira</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kanao_Tsuyuri" title="Kanao Tsuyuri">Kanao Tsuyuri</a>. He felt insulted to be killed by individuals whom he thought lowly of.
            </p><br>
            <p>
            It is later revealed that Doma is clinically apathetic, completely emotionless, and unable to experience proper emotions. Doma himself admitted that the concept of emotion was completely foreign to him, even as a human. Aware that this is abnormal, Doma compensated for his empty heart with his own charisma. He learned to express his carefree demeanor enough to deceive all but the keenest observers.</p><br>
            <p>Despite his innate apathy, he appeared angry when Kanao insulted his inability to feel real emotions, dropping his kindly façade and outright trying to kill her. His apathy is shown when his mother murdered his father and then proceeded to kill herself all while being observed by Doma when he was just a child; Doma didn't show any sign of grief or shock, but instead complained that their blood made the room stuffy.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-da7061fa79f90423f592a14eda174ac0_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-da7061fa79f90423f592a14eda174ac0-15">[15]</a></sup> 
            </p><br>
            <p>Doma primarily eats women as they are known to be more nutritious than men. One exception to this was Inosuke's mother, <a href="/wiki/Kotoha_Hashibira" title="Kotoha Hashibira">Kotoha Hashibira</a>, who Doma didn't want to kill and instead wanted to keep by his side until she died of natural causes, though he eventually killed her when she tried to escape. The reason for this unique behavioral trait is because women provide more nutritional value for demons as they can nurture babies, so therefore provide more strength and nutrients.
            </p><br>
            <p>During his interactions with fellow Upper Rank <a href="/wiki/Akaza" title="Akaza">Akaza</a>, he showed no negative reactions to him delivering two fatal blows to his head in annoyance, one with Akaza swiftly punching the upper part of Doma's head off, then punching his jaw off.<b><sup id="cite_ref-ch98_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ch98-3">[3]</a></sup></b><sup id="cite_ref-auto-f7b30996caa94a406c4f93892906e02a_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-f7b30996caa94a406c4f93892906e02a-16">[16]</a></sup> In fact, he considered this to be their form of personal "greeting" between two "best friends." Doma has even implied that he actually enjoys these physical abuses as seen when he morbidly asked <a href="/wiki/Muzan_Kibutsuji" title="Muzan Kibutsuji">Muzan</a> with excitement on what type of extreme self-harm he should inflict on himself as punishment for his failure,<sup id="cite_ref-auto-9d756e2d5a69d0b6fee8b367655ec697_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-9d756e2d5a69d0b6fee8b367655ec697-17">[17]</a></sup> and again expressed delight upon the severe pain he felt at <a href="/wiki/Shinobu_Kocho" title="Shinobu Kocho">Shinobu Kocho</a>'s numerous attempts to poison him to death and even cheerfully expresses his delight on the feelings and sensations of the poison destroying his body and how he might actually grow to "like" it.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-4788c2da2b262a973182cb46a7642421_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-4788c2da2b262a973182cb46a7642421-18">[18]</a></sup> 
            </p><br>
            <p>Despite leading a cult, Doma is a nihilistic atheist who staunchly believed that gods, Buddhas, and the afterlife do not exist. He believed that after death there is nothing and that people who "could not accept something so simple" are naïve and dumb.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-4814ed91bda60a82ff044c698013ab94_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-4814ed91bda60a82ff044c698013ab94-19">[19]</a></sup> However, during his death, he began to question if Heaven and Hell could actually do exist. Doma also displayed what was arguably is his first true emotion when he proclaimed his love for Shinobu after finding her cute.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-9a89304c830f7ffb0eb83b16101451c5_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-9a89304c830f7ffb0eb83b16101451c5-20">[20]</a></sup>

            <p>As the holder of the second highest ranking member of the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Kizuki" title="Twelve Kizuki">Twelve Kizuki</a>, and the third most powerful of his kind to have ever existed, Doma is an exceptionally powerful demon. His combination of combative prowess and his potent cryokinetic <a href="/wiki/Blood_Demon_Art" title="Blood Demon Art">Blood Demon Art</a> in battle is powerful enough to overwhelm and defeat the <a href="/wiki/Insect_Breathing" title="Insect Breathing">Insect</a> <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a>, <a href="/wiki/Shinobu_Kocho" title="Shinobu Kocho">Shinobu Kocho</a>, without any difficulty,<sup id="cite_ref-auto-f7558b96c48d082be9eb6f32bd2bc6ca_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-f7558b96c48d082be9eb6f32bd2bc6ca-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-a62e2cfca2a2b7dae07102a8abfeb818_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-a62e2cfca2a2b7dae07102a8abfeb818-22">[22]</a></sup> and he is also noted to have defeated <a href="/wiki/Kanae_Kocho" title="Kanae Kocho">Kanae Kocho</a>, the late <a href="/wiki/Flower_Breathing" title="Flower Breathing">Flower</a> Hashira, in the past.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-e6833f52cd399f4eeb4080ce72554dd7_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e6833f52cd399f4eeb4080ce72554dd7-23">[23]</a></sup> Afterwards, Doma could take on both <a href="/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira" title="Inosuke Hashibira">Inosuke</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kanao_Tsuyuri" title="Kanao Tsuyuri">Kanao</a>, who were on par with the Hashira, simultaneously without much effort either. 
            </p><br>
            <p>According to Doma, <a href="/wiki/Akaza" title="Akaza">Akaza</a>, who holds the rank of Upper Three, would have no chance in defeating him in battle, to the point where even he wouldn't dare challenge Doma to a battle, despite the Upper Rank's immense outward hatred toward him.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-b22b997a729b611c5314891a51c0e27c_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-b22b997a729b611c5314891a51c0e27c-24">[24]</a></sup> Moreover, Doma was able to surpass Akaza in a shorter period of time, showcasing the immense power gap between the two demons. As further credence to Doma's immense power, he rarely fights seriously and instead adopts a casual and carefree attitude even in life-and-death situations against the most powerful Demon Slayers, only ever becoming serious when his life is in serious danger, such as when the deadly effects of Shinobu's poisons became apparent.   
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Apathy:</b> Doma is diagnosed as clinically apathetic, unable to experience human emotions. Despite this, he maintains a friendly and carefree façade that deceives all but the most astute observers. Kanao is the only person who can see through his façade, thanks to her exceptional eyesight. She believes that Doma impersonates emotions in the hopes that he could eventually acquire the ability to feel them himself, a concept entirely foreign to him.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-e9662dfee1f54f32a4ec7f8be664be32_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e9662dfee1f54f32a4ec7f8be664be32-25">[25]</a></sup> Even in his childhood, Doma exhibited little to no emotion. When his mother killed his father before taking her own life in front of him, he remained unaffected by the traumatising event; his only reaction was annoyance over the blood that was making the room stuffy.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-da7061fa79f90423f592a14eda174ac0_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-da7061fa79f90423f592a14eda174ac0-15">[15]</a></sup> 
            </p><br>
            <p>This inability to feel emotions has become an advantage for Doma, as this allows him to calmly process, understand and analyze any situation he is faced with without being hampered by emotions, allowing him to easily and quickly come up with any solution for any adversary. Although, after his death, he seemed to have developed feelings for <a href="/wiki/Shinobu_Kocho" title="Shinobu Kocho">Shinobu Kocho</a>, making it the first time he actually shows true emotion.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Keen Intellect:</b> Doma is exceptionally intelligent, which he displayed on multiple occasions. While in a fast-paced brawl with Kanao, he was able to process and deduce her abilities, surmising that it was her superhuman eyesight that allowed her to parry and dodge his ice attacks and immediately develop a strategy to counter it.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-ee5374bf3b0a150efbf0a481680ed3d9_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-ee5374bf3b0a150efbf0a481680ed3d9-26">[26]</a></sup> In another instance, when he left Kanao and Inosuke to fight his ice clones, he construed that Inosuke had an acute sense of touch just by observing his behavior when near his ice techniques.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-140eea4a31a35d9048ef70e9c0bd0c5e_27-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-140eea4a31a35d9048ef70e9c0bd0c5e-27">[27]</a></sup> 
            </p><br>
            <p>It is also implied that Doma was able to trick and deceive all of his followers, allowing him to kill and eat them. He was able to keep this up for over a century with almost complete infallibility. Doma also possesses incredible memory, being able to remember even the most insignificant details from back when he was human, which was over a century ago.

                Fighting Style
            </div>    
            <p><b>Tessenjutsu:</b> Doma is incredibly skilled in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessenjutsu" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tessenjutsu">Tessenjutsu</a> as shown during his battles against the Demon Slayers. It is implied that his skill in this martial arts surpasses <a href="/wiki/Akaza" title="Akaza">Akaza</a>'s bare-fisted combat prowess due to his superior ranking compared to Akaza. Doma showcased his skill in dual wielding his Japanese war fans against <a href="/wiki/Kanao_Tsuyuri" title="Kanao Tsuyuri">Kanao</a> and <a href="/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira" title="Inosuke Hashibira">Inosuke</a>, where he could easily fend off both combatants, displaying his ability in using his fans for both attacking and defending during high-speed battles, parrying and delivering attacks that overwhelmed the Demon Slayers. 
            </p><br>
            <p>With his exceptional proficiency in Tessenjutsu, Doma could make use of techniques that require him to perform eight to nine fan attacks in the blink of an eye and generate huge gusts of air with them. Furthermore, Doma's Tessenjutsu incorporates his cryokinetic Blood Demon Art which enhances its range and lethality, making his fighting style a great blend of offense and defense.

            <p><b>Cryokinesis:</b> Doma's Blood Demon Art grants him extremely powerful cryokinesis. He can generate ice and frost from his flesh and blood and can spawn it anywhere in his vicinity, as well as manipulating it at will, allowing him to unleash incredibly potent ice techniques. Additionally, the ice created from his Blood Demon Art is extremely lethal to those that inhale it, causing the cells of the victim's lungs to die and rendering them unable to breathe very quickly. His ice and frost have also been noted to be extremely cold, as shown when the air around Doma's frost was cold enough to make Shinobu's lungs feel as if they were about to burst and nearly freeze Kanao's body and surroundings just by coming into contact with it.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-842c731a99a39019551dd4b2b69f3542_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-842c731a99a39019551dd4b2b69f3542-44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-dd55713609323897773dd9419a0f7c69_45-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-dd55713609323897773dd9419a0f7c69-45">[45]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p>Doma is incredibly proficient in his Blood Demon Art, being capable of creating constructs out of the ice he generates such as frost lotuses, stalagmites, clouds of icy air and even miniature ice clones of himself capable of unleashing the same techniques as him. He has also shown the ability to use the ice he creates as extra appendages, as seen when he created ice vines to hold himself up the ceiling while he uses his arms to hug <a href="/wiki/Shinobu_Kocho" title="Shinobu Kocho">Shinobu</a>. In combat, Doma usually incorporates his cryokinetic abilities with his Tessenjutsu, enhancing his fan attacks with ice and frost. Doma prefers to use his Blood Demon Art to create frost lotuses and crystal-like shards made of ice.
