            </div>

            <p>Muichiro is a young boy of fair skin and short stature with a lean muscular build along with long, straight hair of a black color that fades to soft cyan as it approaches his waist. He wears his hair loose with two clumps protruding slightly from each side of his head, a set of marginally shorter hair left down to frame his face, and unruly bangs over his forehead. He also possesses large, empty-looking soft cyan eyes. He is identical in appearance to his older twin brother <a href="/wiki/Yuichiro_Tokito" title="Yuichiro Tokito">Yuichiro</a>.
            </p><br>
            <p>Following his meeting with <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro Kamado</a> and the return of his childhood memories, Muichiro's once empty looking eyes seem to now have a hopeful glimmer that is accompanied with a more upbeat and cheery expression, reminiscent of his former demeanor before the death of Yuichiro.
            </p><br>
            <p>Muichiro wears a dark, slightly turquoise-tinted version of the <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Corps" title="Demon Slayer Corps">Demon Slayer</a> uniform. His uniform has longer, looser sleeves that are more reminiscent of those of a kimono than of the standard cuffed uniform. Along with this, the lack of bands of cloth wrapped around his calves gives his uniform an overall loose and sizable appearance. He also has dark blue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabi" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Tabi">tabi socks</a> and a pair of white <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C5%8Dri" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Zōri">zōri</a> with dark blue straps. 
            </p><br>
            <p>When Muichiro was young, he wore a light, sleeveless yukata with a light blue mist design, similar to the darker one <a href="/wiki/Yuichiro_Tokito" title="Yuichiro Tokito">his brother</a> wore when they were both ten. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Due to Tanjiro's presence around him, Muichiro manifested his <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Mark" title="Demon Slayer Mark">Demon Slayer Mark</a> during the battle against the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Kizuki" title="Twelve Kizuki">Upper Rank</a> 5 <a href="/wiki/Gyokko" title="Gyokko">Gyokko</a>. Muichiro's mark is dark red coloured, resembling mist shaped clouds on both his cheeks and forehead.   
            </p>

            <div class="personality title" id="personality">
                Personality
            </div>
            <p>Muichiro is an air-headed individual who seems to constantly wander off in thought and is unable to focus on anything. Impassive and, at times, obtuse, he tends to think only for himself and operates on logic alone, never letting emotions guide him, making him seem seemingly apathetic and indifferent. However, <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro Kamado</a> sensed that Muichiro wasn't being apathetic on purpose as he didn't emanate any animosity. Despite his mostly uncaring and unserious demeanor, he has been shown to become serious when it is required and is devoted to his position as the <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Corps" title="Demon Slayer Corps">Demon Slayer Corps</a>' <a href="/wiki/Mist_Breathing" title="Mist Breathing">Mist</a> <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a>. Alternatively he seems to display a cold and arrogant side; as shown by him violently shaking down <a href="/wiki/Kotetsu" title="Kotetsu">Kotetsu</a> and calling him stupid, saying his time as a Hashira was important, more so than his own, and that <i>all</i> that the swordsmiths could do was make weapons. Despite this, Muichiro doesn't seem to be indifferent towards <a href="/wiki/Kagaya_Ubuyashiki" title="Kagaya Ubuyashiki">Kagaya Ubuyashiki</a>, most likely due to his immense respect for his master.
            </p><br>
            <p>However, before the death of his <a href="/wiki/Yuichiro_Tokito" title="Yuichiro Tokito">twin brother</a> when the siblings were eleven, Muichiro's personality was that of a much more compassionate and optimistic individual, the polar opposite of his current disposition. Having originally taken after his father, he was shown to display a higher level of kindness and understanding, believing he should aim to do good for others if he wanted good to be done for him. When told by <a href="/wiki/Amane_Ubuyashiki" title="Amane Ubuyashiki">Amane Ubuyashiki</a> that they were descendants to Demon Slayers of old, Muichiro became excited at the prospect of being able to protect people. 
            </p><br>
            <p>After his brother was attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Demon" title="Demon">demon</a> and witnessing his final moments and death, Muichiro subsequently lost his memories and has held an omnipresent rage deeply suppressed inside of him that inevitably drove his future, intense training. After this memory loss, he started exhibiting the indifferent attitude of his twin brother he is now known for as a <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a>. Following his <a href="/wiki/Muichiro_Tokito_vs_Gyokko" title="Muichiro Tokito vs Gyokko">battle</a> with <a href="/wiki/Gyokko" title="Gyokko">Gyokko</a> and reuniting with Tanjiro after the latter's battle with <a href="/wiki/Hantengu" title="Hantengu">Hantengu</a>, he warmly thanked Tanjiro for helping him regain his identity and showed concern for his wellbeing.
            </p><br>
            <p>During his later interactions with <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro</a>, Muichiro started regaining his memories of his past, causing him to behave more maturely and seriously, even choosing to help <a href="/wiki/Kotetsu" title="Kotetsu">Kotetsu</a> when his life was in danger instead of ignoring him. After his memory was fully restored, Muichiro began expressing more emotions and became more confident in himself and started caring more for his peers in the <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Corps" title="Demon Slayer Corps">Demon Slayer Corps</a>. He also started exhibiting emotions common for someone his age, particularly childishness and immaturity when interacting with his other <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer" title="Demon Slayer">Demon Slayers</a>. He also appears to be evidently biased towards Tanjiro after his battle with <a href="/wiki/Gyokko" title="Gyokko">Gyokko</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Swordsmith_Village" title="Swordsmith Village">Swordsmith Village</a>, as his cheerful demeanor when around him was replaced by a cold indifference when around other Demon Slayers. However, he was shown to be more aware of himself and those around him, evident when he realized that <a href="/wiki/Obanai_Iguro" title="Obanai Iguro">Obanai Iguro</a> had a crush on <a href="/wiki/Mitsuri_Kanroji" title="Mitsuri Kanroji">Mitsuri Kanroji</a>, which surprised <a href="/wiki/Gyomei_Himejima" title="Gyomei Himejima">Gyomei Himejima</a>. His kindness also aided him in building friendships among the Demon Slayers and making happy memories like the ones back when he lived with his family.
