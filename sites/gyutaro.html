            <p>Gyutaro was a tall man of fairly muscular build, with a pale gray complexion speckled with black blotches. His anatomy was quite strange in that his upper torso, arms, and legs were all defined with musculature, whereas his waist was incredibly skinny to the point of looking skeletal, with his pelvis jutting out at an unnatural angle. His spine was prominently visible through his back, and he was usually shown being hunched over. Gyutaro possessed thin, green and red eyes, their sclera bright yellow-orange, that were slanted drastically downwards at the sides, giving him a permanently haggard gaze.

He had unruly black hair that transitioned to a brighter lime green around the crown of his head, worn messily in uneven bangs and several locks. His body and limbs had noticeable ink-like markings in the form of black spots on his body and a flowing water-like pattern on his face. He also had a full set of sharp, interlocking teeth. Gyutaro was described to look very ugly.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-637a2357e2dc79a410471023d01a8eed_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-637a2357e2dc79a410471023d01a8eed-7">[7]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p>Gyutaro wore little, only sporting a pair of baggy blue pants and seven pieces of pattern red cloth to decorate his body, one large one around his neck and three smaller ones around each arm.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a human, Gyutaro had similar facial features as he did as a demon, notably the ink-like blotches on his face. He also possessed the same strange contorted anatomy and hair that he had when he turned into a demon. His eyes were notably bloodshot and were a pale blue color, with visible veins lining his sclera, and he had missing and uneven teeth. He was seen wearing a dirty, tattered kimono when he was a child, but after Ume was born and he started working for a brothel as her collector, his clothes changed to  a short-sleeved wide-striped kimono with a notably cleaner and firmer fabric. He remained barefoot in both his lives as a human and a <a href="/wiki/Demon" title="Demon">demon</a>.

            <div class="personality title" id="personality">
                Personality
            </div>
            <p>Gyutaro was cruel, ruthless, petty, and envious of anyone blessed with a better life than him, owing to a life of near-constant poverty and the harsh tragedies he experienced as a human. He developed a habit of sarcastically complimenting a person's best traits before trying to vindictively kill them afterwards, as he did to the samurai who attempted to kill him and <a href="/wiki/Tengen_Uzui" title="Tengen Uzui">Tengen Uzui</a> after seeing his appearance. Because of the hardships he faced as a human, Gyutaro attained a personal belief that to take from those who have a better life than he had as a human was justified. A habit that developed from this belief was the penchant to inflict harm to himself whenever he was angry, frustrated or jealous, as seen when he scratched himself hard enough to tear deep wounds into his own flesh when he grew jealous of Tengen.
            </p><br>
            <p>Having lived over a hundred years and battled many <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Corps" title="Demon Slayer Corps">Demon Slayers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a>, Gyutaro became arrogant and prideful in combat, developing the habit of underestimating his opponents and looking down on them as beneath him, as he did with the team of Demon Slayers dispatched to kill him by having his sister fight and deal with them first rather than himself. He has also showed himself to be intensely sadistic, revelling in the defeat of the Demon Slayers by horrifically injuring them and tormenting the helpless Tanjiro for his own enjoyment. 
            </p><br>
            <p>Despite his negative traits, Gyutaro possessed a genuine, strong love for his younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Daki" title="Daki">Ume</a>. Having raised her himself due to his mother's mental instability and later death, this familial love was so strong that, even after becoming a demon and nearly forgetting his life as a human, he still retained a considerable attachment to her. Due to this, he occasionally spoilt and allowed her to do whatever she pleases, even if her actions went against his best interests. However, his love for her did not stop him from screaming and insulting her out of frustration. When he first exposed himself, he tenderly attended to his sister's cries and injuries, both praising her efforts while insulting her lack of intelligence.
            </p><br>
            <p>Upon his death and final thoughts, Gyutaro possessed no regrets in the choices he made throughout his life, especially his choice of willingly becoming a demon and his subsequent actions of killing and eating untold scores of people throughout his life, showing how misanthropic and bitter he had become due to his terrible and harsh circumstances as a human. However, he later recognized that the only true regret he holds in his life was his sister, Ume, showing that deep down, Gyutaro regretted that his negative influence through how he raised her was the cause for her growth into a selfish person.

            <p>During his final moments, Gyutaro wondered if she could have experienced many other wonderful things and lived many different lives without having to walk on the path of becoming a demon if he wasn't in her life. He genuinely wished that she was born and raised by someone other than himself, completely shouldering the blame for all of her deplorable actions and showing just how much he loves her. In death, Gyutaro was shown to have Ume's best interests at heart by telling her to go to the opposite direction where the light was better, showing that he wished Daki would have a fresh start to a new life without him being a bad influence on her.

            </div>
            <p>As the true Upper Rank Six, Gyutaro was an extremely powerful demon with over a century's worth of combat experience under his belt, having killed and devoured 15 <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a> in the past.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-0d17cb7d2f2a0bf21aded588bfdf18e1_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-0d17cb7d2f2a0bf21aded588bfdf18e1-8">[8]</a></sup> His strength and his abilities were made evident when he was able to easily combat both <a href="/wiki/Tengen_Uzui" title="Tengen Uzui">Tengen Uzui</a>, the Sound Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, and <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro Kamado</a>, a talented Demon Slayer who had fought Lower Rank demons in the past, at the same time and eventually overwhelm them in battle. Even when the battle turned in the favor of the Demon Slayers, Gyutaro and <a href="/wiki/Daki" title="Daki">Daki</a> quickly managed to take control of the situation and drive them into a corner.
            </p><br>
            <p>Another testament to his power was the fact that despite being killed in battle, Gyutaro was still capable of severely injuring Tengen, Tanjiro, <a href="/wiki/Zenitsu_Agatsuma" title="Zenitsu Agatsuma">Zenitsu</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira" title="Inosuke Hashibira">Inosuke</a> and would have likely killed them all had it not been for <a href="/wiki/Nezuko_Kamado" title="Nezuko Kamado">Nezuko</a>, who neutralized his final attack with her <a href="/wiki/Blood_Demon_Art" title="Blood Demon Art">Blood Demon Art</a>. Even as a human, Gyutaro was a naturally talented fighter, as displayed by how he was able to kill an adult samurai in one strike without ever having received any combat training beforehand.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Tactical Intellect:</b> Gyutaro displayed incredible tactical foresight and intelligence. He was able to use the information he gathered from <a href="/wiki/Daki" title="Daki">Daki</a> to coordinate their attacks against his opponents. Gyutaro was also able to use his <a href="/wiki/Blood_Demon_Art" title="Blood Demon Art">Blood Demon Art</a> tactically to create inescapable attacks.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-15c7a2d127ee730ff26f205954e0e2ac_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-15c7a2d127ee730ff26f205954e0e2ac-9">[9]</a></sup> After seeing <a href="/wiki/Hinatsuru" title="Hinatsuru">Hinatsuru</a> fire a barrage of kunai, Gyutaro correctly surmised that mounting an attack that would normally be easily mitigated by his regeneration had an underlying motive and chose to deflect the attack rather than taking it head on.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-d9422e437c9af2ac7f255ff4b5809062_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-d9422e437c9af2ac7f255ff4b5809062-10">[10]</a></sup> He was also shown to use his flesh manipulation ability in creative ways, such as trapping Tengen's and <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro</a>'s blade in his flesh Kama to keep them from moving.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-4aebfff3f970b5dc8c4dc2f54db452d4_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-4aebfff3f970b5dc8c4dc2f54db452d4-11">[11]</a></sup> Lastly, albeit post-facto, Gyutaro figured out Tanjiro's strategy which was to disguise the scent of the wisteria-laced kunai with a prostitute's incense bag in order to land a surprise attack on him.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-9979389396170ecdd4294a2a93c68589_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-9979389396170ecdd4294a2a93c68589-12">[12]</a></sup>

                Fighting Style
            </div>    
            <p><b>Kama Proficiency:</b> Gyutaro displayed mastery in dual wielding his flesh <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_(weapon)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Kama (weapon)">Kama</a> in combat. As an Upper Rank demon, he lived for over a century and has refined his skill to the point he can surpass the <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a>, the strongest swordsmen in the <a href="/wiki/Demon_Slayer_Corps" title="Demon Slayer Corps">Demon Slayer Corps</a>, in close ranged combat. Even before he became a demon, Gyutaro has shown to be apt in utilizing his Kama for violence, easily killing a woman and later slicing an adult swordsman's head in two with them when he was enraged. With his demon abilities, he could even control and move his flesh Kama telekinetically, which Gyutaro used to make them fly back to him like a boomerang.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-73502b68881854e937eb4c6f22f6e5f7_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-73502b68881854e937eb4c6f22f6e5f7-19">[19]</a></sup> As noted by Tengen and Inosuke, Gyutaro's fighting style was comparable to that of a praying mantis.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-477492a729f9c31915d9c0cba46fd8e3_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-477492a729f9c31915d9c0cba46fd8e3-40">[40]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-4b34d7dba9ef88a0ee4f2c41a557ade3_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-4b34d7dba9ef88a0ee4f2c41a557ade3-41">[41]</a></sup> Gyutaro's combat style seemed to revolve around aiming to piercing his opponent's neck with the tip of his Kama.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Blood Manipulation:</b> Gyutaro's Blood Demon Art allowed him to manipulate his own body's blood in various ways. He was shown to generate them from his flesh Kama or from open wounds on his body or release blood at will from his veins.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-a8739e46ef3c1c3b8c0e61d9ae9cab13_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-a8739e46ef3c1c3b8c0e61d9ae9cab13-42">[42]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-8040bfd01812ac9bb4b0d24d4cb3112c_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-8040bfd01812ac9bb4b0d24d4cb3112c-43">[43]</a></sup> It was implied that Gyutaro doesn't run out of blood due to his regenerative abilities, giving him a virtually infinite source of blood to fuel his techniques. In combat, he usually created barrages of solidified sickle-shaped blood as sharp as blades that can travel at immensely fast speeds to attack his opponents. Gyutaro was capable of freely manipulating these blood slashes at will, altering their movements until they hit his opponent<sup id="cite_ref-auto-5e4e087c41fac09b2f9d4b858c2118f8_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-5e4e087c41fac09b2f9d4b858c2118f8-15">[15]</a></sup> or shaping them however he pleased. Furthermore, his blood sickles were coated in deadly poison.
            </p><br>
            <p>Gyutaro could use his Blood Demon Art tactically to create inescapable attacks that can overwhelm the likes of <a href="/wiki/Tengen_Uzui" title="Tengen Uzui">Tengen</a><sup id="cite_ref-auto-15c7a2d127ee730ff26f205954e0e2ac_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-15c7a2d127ee730ff26f205954e0e2ac-9">[9]</a></sup> and hold off the combined efforts of <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro</a>, <a href="/wiki/Zenitsu_Agatsuma" title="Zenitsu Agatsuma">Zenitsu</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira" title="Inosuke Hashibira">Inosuke</a>. Moreover, the poison in Gyutaro's blood slashes appeared to be extremely deadly as Inosuke noted that a single scratch from them would be enough to kill him.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-e5baa6faa0ae6eb63a5086067be36ec6_44-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e5baa6faa0ae6eb63a5086067be36ec6-44">[44]</a></sup> The blood he manipulated was shown to be quite durable as well since Tanjiro deduced that his sword would shatter if he took the technique head on without deflecting it.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-b2e27af8e97b325ab6463937ba2b4c5f_45-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-b2e27af8e97b325ab6463937ba2b4c5f-45">[45]</a></sup> Furthermore, Gyutaro could create a shield of blood in the form of a dome, which he used to protect himself from a barrage of kunai, further exemplifying its immense durability.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-8fa65b02bbc2975acf121bf50398c53d_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-8fa65b02bbc2975acf121bf50398c53d-46">[46]</a></sup> More impressively, Gyutaro can create long-ranged circular torrents of razor sharp blood that can decimate the surroundings with ease.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-8040bfd01812ac9bb4b0d24d4cb3112c_43-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-8040bfd01812ac9bb4b0d24d4cb3112c-43">[43]</a></sup>
