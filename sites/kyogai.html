            <p>Kyogai was a very tall, muscular, humanoid demon, possessing grayish skin, black hair, razor sharp teeth, pointy ears, blood red sclera, deep blue pupils and hidden irises due to it being rolled up to the back of his head. His right eye had the Kanji of the number Six, which signified his position as Lower Rank Six of the Twelve Kizuki, but due to being deemed too weak, his rank was stripped and the eye containing his mark was slashed by Muzan, leaving behind a white X-shaped scar covering the number, signifying that he was no longer one of the Twelve Kizuki. Another one of his unique physical characteristics is that his stomach, shoulders, hips, front chest and back all had drums protruding from them of which he uses for his Blood Demon Art.
            </p><br>



            <div class="personality title" id="personality">
                Personality
            </div>
            <p>Kyogai was a relatively quiet, calculating, and soft-spoken demon, differing himself from the more ubiquitous loud, bloodthirsty, and aggressive kind. Rather than scream or roar when annoyed, Kyogai quietly murmured about whatever was irritating him. He believed it was rude for people to barge into his home and would destroy them for getting in his way. If irritated enough, Kyogai raised his voice about the nuisance and insulted his opponents.
            </p><br>
            <p>Upon first becoming a demon, Kyogai believed Muzan's blood would make him infinitely stronger. However, when his strength became finite after growing unable to get stronger from eating humans, Kyogai was cast out by his master. Desperate to please Muzan and prove the worth of his Blood Demon Art, Kyogai became obsessed with consuming "marechi", humans with rare blood.
            </p><br>
            <p>Above all else, Kyogai truly desired to be recognized for his talent. He wanted people to love his writing and was devastated when he was told to give up on it as a human. To redeem himself from this humiliation, Kyogai tried to prove himself as a powerful demon in the Twelve Kizuki. This obsessive need to prove the worth of his drum playing was why he tried so desperately to reclaim his spot. Upon his death, when Tanjiro Kamado recognized his talent, it allowed Kyogai's soul to rest in peace, happy that someone had finally acknowledged his skills.
            </p><br>

            <div class="heading title" id="History">History</div>
            <p>Sometime after becoming a <a href="/wiki/Demon" title="Demon">demon</a>, Kyogai was lectured by an unknown individual over the quality of his writings. This person noted that he had become boring, only beating his drum and not leaving his house, and didn't have the skills to teach people. As he left, the individual stepped on one of the demon's papers, causing an irate Kyogai to kill him.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-01293d13435bed76612a5618e247c374_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-01293d13435bed76612a5618e247c374-2">[2]</a></sup>

            <p>While still a member of the <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Kizuki" title="Twelve Kizuki">Twelve Kizuki</a>, Kyogai slowly lost the ability to eat humans. He was visited by <a href="/wiki/Muzan_Kibutsuji" title="Muzan Kibutsuji">Muzan Kibutsuji</a>, who removed his number due to the Drum Demon having reached his limit. Because of this, Kyogai obsessively began his quest to rejoin the Twelve Kizuki.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-dfca9df7f7adc78e50016fe3ffe076bb_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-dfca9df7f7adc78e50016fe3ffe076bb-3">[3]</a></sup>

            <p>Kyogai was a relatively powerful demon and was the strongest one Tanjiro had faced at that point. His unusual Blood Demon Art and obsessive hunger for Kiyoshi's blood made him all the more dangerous. He held off a Mizunoto-ranked Tanjiro and Inosuke together with ease and his slashes prevented them from getting a good strike. His constant changing of the room's orientation also served him well, as Tanjiro became greatly disoriented and was barely survive getting hit. However, the range and potency of his attacks ultimately was not enough to overcome Tanjiro's will to keep fighting, as the Demon Slayer was able to adapt to his techniques in a relatively short span of time.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Drumming Skills:</b> Kyogai showed excellent proficiency at playing tsuzumi drums, which later became the inspiration for his Blood Demon Art. It is shown in a flashback that when he was human, he wrote several drafts of songs and music notes even though they went unused due to someone mocking and berating him for it, which caused him to play the drum located at his stomach, killing the man.
