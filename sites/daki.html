            <p>Daki was a very prideful, dismissive, and sadistic person, taking enjoyment in toying with her victims before killing them and not showing the slightest bit of guilt or remorse for taking the lives of her victims.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-f58925b11db846baca0eb63abc2596ef_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-f58925b11db846baca0eb63abc2596ef-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-5fa9ca38dfd1d428053e40e08953911f_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-5fa9ca38dfd1d428053e40e08953911f-14">[14]</a></sup> She thought very highly of herself, dismissing all non-<a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a> Demon Slayers as not worth her time,<sup id="cite_ref-auto-e3233da089bff42b92d93bf201b3aa73_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e3233da089bff42b92d93bf201b3aa73-15">[15]</a></sup> and getting incensed when <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro Kamado</a> spoke to her, because she looked down on him.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-085dbb405154cb4951c1cd7883ae77ff_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-085dbb405154cb4951c1cd7883ae77ff-16">[16]</a></sup> This was also shown when Daki said that she might spare Tanjiro if he told her how many Demon Slayers are present in the <a href="/wiki/Yoshiwara,_Tokyo" class="mw-redirect" title="Yoshiwara, Tokyo">Entertainment District</a>, and when Daki openly expressed how slow the Demon Slayer's techniques were and her boredom,<sup id="cite_ref-auto-2f99abd36b5f6f79fd64120195e345b6_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-2f99abd36b5f6f79fd64120195e345b6-17">[17]</a></sup> which further showcased her arrogant and dismissive personality.
            </p><br>
            <p>Despite being over a hundred years old, she displayed childish and bratty tendencies such as throwing tantrums, crying hysterically when things didn't go her way, and lashing out against anyone to vent her frustrations. Putting her venomous hostility on full display numerous times, she was both verbally and physically abusive towards anybody that displeased her in any way. She had a certain number of habits that were well recorded in history, in particular: her use of the word for princess, "Hime",  at the end of any of the identities she assumed, because she believed her to be worth more than others, and a habit of angling her head to the sides and glaring at others while sitting when criticized.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-ae0ed33a0884896a80dd464c3e0333a2_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-ae0ed33a0884896a80dd464c3e0333a2-18">[18]</a></sup>As an oiran, Daki was extremely cruel and wicked, pulling on a young girl's ear because she didn't clean up her room, yelling at any attendant or aide in the <a href="/wiki/Kyogoku_House" title="Kyogoku House">Kyogoku House</a> and punching <a href="/wiki/Zenitsu_Agatsuma" title="Zenitsu Agatsuma">Zenitsu Agatsuma</a> into the other room for merely touching her. She also preferred to only eat people that she viewed as beautiful or strong, choosing to kill those who got on her nerves without eating them and leaving their bodies behind, which people often mistook as suicide.
            </p><br>
            <p>Daki displayed a spoiled and disdainful demeanor that bordered on sociopathic behavior, harassing many of her fellow workers to the point of suicide, purely because they annoyed or retorted her, all the while showing no traces of guilt. In fact, she deflected the blame onto her victims for offending her. Her great pride in herself meant that she had no respect for anyone, not even her House's owners, rubbing on their faces that she was their central source of income as both a way to display her status and halt their objections towards her. She was so drunk on her standing and infamously violent tendencies that people had to resort to bowing their heads in order to calm her angry outbursts, to which she responded to by putting up a corrected, more polite and affable stance. Regardless of all her faults, she was an exceptionally skilled courtesan whose many identities had always earned great fame and significant earnings.
            </p><br>
            <p>On top of having exceedingly petulant and aggressive tendencies, Daki hailed her transformation as the greatest thing that has ever happened to her, most likely due to the extreme poverty and near-death experience she faced during her human life, openly denouncing her humanity in front of Tanjiro and claiming that as a demon, she can do anything she pleases.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-019f803568cb13573f40e23de739515e_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-019f803568cb13573f40e23de739515e-19">[19]</a></sup> This pride in her nature as a demon, and especially as an Upper Rank, was cause for her to cry and whine when Tengen Uzui did not believe that she had the strength of one, to the point where she threw a tantrum while wailing and spewing threats at the Hashira.
            </p><br>
            <p>As seen during her fight against Nezuko, Daki also had a deep psychological fear of fire, due to having been burned alive at the age of 13 in her human life, evidently displayed when she screamed hysterically after Nezuko set her ablaze with her Blood Demon Art.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-5205fc66c7eec041886335970f904d33_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-5205fc66c7eec041886335970f904d33-20">[20]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p>In stark contrast to her bossy, dominating and violent exterior, Daki was fanatically loyal to Muzan, bowing her head immediately and speaking in a considerably meeker voice tone while being both visibly terrified and mesmerized by his presence. This was well known to him to the point he actively honey-laced his words towards her in order to easily motivate and direct her actions, despite the fact he thought badly of her abilities in comparison to her brother.
            </p><br>
            <p>She seemed to have a somewhat caring relationship with her brother, <a href="/wiki/Gyutaro" title="Gyutaro">Gyutaro</a>, though it did not stop her from insulting and ridiculing him when they both failed, showing that despite her love for her brother, she wasn't above ranting and lashing out at him, as shown when she spoke cruelly of him upon their defeat, even insulting his appearance and viciously claiming that he couldn't possibly be her brother.
            </p><br>
            <p>However, underneath her spoiled attitude towards her brother, Daki possessed a strong genuine love for him, as seen during her time in Limbo, where, despite Gyutaro attempting to sever ties with her and try to send her to heaven, she stubbornly refuses to abandon her brother, even if it meant going to Hell together with him. Having tearfully reminded him that no matter what happened to them, they were at their strongest together and promised that no matter how many times she died and was reborn, she would always be his little sister.
            </p><br>
            <p>It was noted by Gyutaro that as a human, she possessed an easily influenced, impressionable and honest personality, causing her to easily take up the personality traits and words of those she trusts and admired to heart, as evident by Muzan's manipulation. He himself believed that the sole reason why she is like she is now was due to her being raised by him to be selfish and to only worry and care about herself, due to taking to heart his words of "take before you're taken from", resulting in her current personality. He also believed that had she been raised in a normal household and was taught proper morals and teachings, she would have become the polar opposite of her current self.

                Abilities
            </div>
            <p>As the secondary holder of Upper Rank Six, Daki was an extremely powerful demon, having killed and devoured seven <a href="/wiki/Hashira" title="Hashira">Hashira</a> in the past. Her flesh detachment in the form of an sentient obi sash was strong enough to hold off the combined efforts of <a href="/wiki/Zenitsu_Agatsuma" title="Zenitsu Agatsuma">Zenitsu Agatsuma</a>, <a href="/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira" title="Inosuke Hashibira">Inosuke Hashibira</a>, <a href="/wiki/Makio" title="Makio">Makio</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Suma" title="Suma">Suma</a>, the former two being seasoned Demon Slayers while the latter two being experienced kunoichi. Even while weakened due to dispersing her power through her obi across the city, she already proved a handful for <a href="/wiki/Tanjiro_Kamado" title="Tanjiro Kamado">Tanjiro Kamado</a>, who had begun to actively use the <a href="/wiki/Hinokami_Kagura" title="Hinokami Kagura">Hinokami Kagura</a> in combat.
            </p><br>
            <p>After her sentient flesh obi spread across the entire city had returned to her, Daki regained her full strength.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-444839d13abacfeb40389466459be62c_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-444839d13abacfeb40389466459be62c-21">[21]</a></sup> In this form, her speed was incomparable from before and her sashes also become more durable, allowing them to slice <a href="/wiki/Nezuko_Kamado" title="Nezuko Kamado">Nezuko Kamado</a>'s body in half and destroy an entire street's worth of buildings with ease.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-f4f816bf23e417144a811c0799b9127f_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-f4f816bf23e417144a811c0799b9127f-22">[22]</a></sup> Furthermore, once <a href="/wiki/Gyutaro" title="Gyutaro">Gyutaro</a>'s eye was implanted in her, Daki's power was amplified once again, giving her improved speed and reflexes that enabled her to outclass the likes of Zenitsu's <b>Thunderclap and Flash</b> technique.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-0c937fb3d78f9748787bbbbcbbce311e_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-0c937fb3d78f9748787bbbbcbbce311e-23">[23]</a></sup> This also allowed Daki to coordinate her attacks with her brother, drastically increasing their offensive output and easily turning the tables against the combined efforts of Tanjiro, Zenitsu, Inosuke, and even <a href="/wiki/Tengen_Uzui" title="Tengen Uzui">Tengen Uzui</a>, the Sound Hashira.
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Keen Intellect:</b> Daki possessed above average levels of intellect. She was able to lure and trap courtesans for over a century without being caught, and was able to effectively blend in with all the other inhabitants in <a href="/wiki/Yoshiwara,_Tokyo" class="mw-redirect" title="Yoshiwara, Tokyo">Yoshiwara</a> without being noticed by <a href="/wiki/Tengen_Uzui" title="Tengen Uzui">Tengen</a>, who possesses extremely sharp senses. As an Oiran, Daki would also have had high education to climb to her position. Furthermore, Daki was able to discern that Zenitsu was a Demon Slayer after noticing his defensive posture in a single glance.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-ace1b79b2edea5f45396279514a1d7ca_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-ace1b79b2edea5f45396279514a1d7ca-24">[24]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p><b>Skilled Courtesan:</b> Daki had unparalleled skills as a courtesan, with her many identities being well known through the Entertainment District's history which brought great fortunes to houses that hosted her.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-0173f0af228daec696350a47013c4aa5_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-0173f0af228daec696350a47013c4aa5-25">[25]</a></sup> She in turn used her elevated status to get away with many of her abusive practices.

            <p><b>Obi Sash Manipulation:</b> Daki's Blood Demon Art allowed her to create flower-patterned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi_(sash)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Obi (sash)">obi</a> sashes from her flesh, as well as freely manipulating them at will.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-22681082dc33c1fb6087faef2108e188_45-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-22681082dc33c1fb6087faef2108e188-45">[45]</a></sup> Daki often created these sashes from her back and retracts them back into her body when not in use. She has also displayed the ability to exert control over her obi from extremely far distances. Her sashes are noted to be soft like silk yet as sharp as a <a href="/wiki/Nichirin_Sword" title="Nichirin Sword">Nichirin Sword</a>. In combat, Daki used her obi sashes as powerful and fast tendril-like whips to unleash long-ranged interweaving attacks while also being able to use it to form a shield around her body if need be, making her Blood Demon Art an extremely effective blend of offense and defense. Her sashes were so powerful that they could repel and block attacks from Tengen's explosives<sup id="cite_ref-auto-1535177de8c5c4943b8db109b30ac4d8_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-1535177de8c5c4943b8db109b30ac4d8-46">[46]</a></sup> and slice up buildings with ease.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-0234e719b3557994f1f5407f65d419b2_47-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-0234e719b3557994f1f5407f65d419b2-47">[47]</a></sup> Furthermore, they are especially difficult to cut because of their soft properties, and can further loosen the effectiveness of slash attacks by bending and weaving.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-73c44ee80f01fcab3b45ba3d0117ac56_48-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-73c44ee80f01fcab3b45ba3d0117ac56-48">[48]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-19a5ea3b0c62e554671c9b551b739e13_49-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-19a5ea3b0c62e554671c9b551b739e13-49">[49]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <p>Her sashes had a unique property that allows her to store objects, usually humans she wanted to eat, inside her sashes. She traps them inside the sashes by transforming the objects she wishes to store into 2 dimensional flat versions of said object.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-ed9e4d20b7375fec242d3bab2370f79a_50-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-ed9e4d20b7375fec242d3bab2370f79a-50">[50]</a></sup> This allowed her to be stealthy with her movements, as any opening or pathway that is wide enough for a sash to fit in is one that she can take.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-3af3b6d63d630368fc53a4514c35475e_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-3af3b6d63d630368fc53a4514c35475e-51">[51]</a></sup> To free someone from being trapped in the sashes, one must cut it apart while avoiding cutting the people trapped inside, immediately freeing anyone and returning them to their original form.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-c146eee5d92342ba52f9663315a41c74_52-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-c146eee5d92342ba52f9663315a41c74-52">[52]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-auto-7efa62c2f2d93ccfa5df9c4a91efb1a5_53-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-7efa62c2f2d93ccfa5df9c4a91efb1a5-53">[53]</a></sup> Daki mainly used this ability to store humans that she wishes to eat in a space underground and consume them later. Lastly, Daki can transmute her own neck into a sash to prevent herself from being decapitated.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-86dbfcee126aa8b9daddd79e36b6a9ac_54-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-86dbfcee126aa8b9daddd79e36b6a9ac-54">[54]</a></sup>
            </p><br>
            <ul><li><b>Sentient Flesh Obi:</b> Daki had also displayed the ability to create obi sashes with cognitive functions as well,<sup id="cite_ref-auto-b932f3311db9da6f72ca96e2268e8e0d_55-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-b932f3311db9da6f72ca96e2268e8e0d-55">[55]</a></sup> which she does to guard and protect her "store house" where she kept her food. The sentient sashes also have a secondary purpose, which is to capture women in the brothels of the <a href="/wiki/Yoshiwara,_Tokyo" class="mw-redirect" title="Yoshiwara, Tokyo">Entertainment District</a> and to gain information about them, as seen when it interrogated <a href="/wiki/Makio" title="Makio">Makio</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-96cade633ce397410eabdd83c2fbe641_56-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-96cade633ce397410eabdd83c2fbe641-56">[56]</a></sup> She also created another living obi sash to monitor and watch over <a href="/wiki/Hinatsuru" title="Hinatsuru">Hinatsuru</a> as she suspected her of being a spy for the Demon Slayers and then kill her if anything goes amiss.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-e64194659597fff9cf4143f9fa4af686_57-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-e64194659597fff9cf4143f9fa4af686-57">[57]</a></sup> Daki can also telepathically communicate with her sentient sashes, shown when she could give it instructions and watch over <a href="/wiki/Inosuke_Hashibira" title="Inosuke Hashibira">Inosuke</a> fighting.<sup id="cite_ref-auto-97875e5ebf4315e332d978fd1516a275_43-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-auto-97875e5ebf4315e332d978fd1516a275-43">[43]</a></sup>
                <ul><li><b>Power Distribution:</b> Daki has shown that when she creates her independent flesh obi sashes, she actually separates a portion of her strength and places it into them. This is seen where after the sashes returned to her and was reabsorbed into her body, Daki's power was stated to have drastically increased as she physically transformed. This was noted by Tanjiro upon noticing that her scent became much stronger and more ominous after her sashes had been absorbed back into her body.</li></ul></li></ul><br>
